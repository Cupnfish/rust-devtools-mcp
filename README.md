## High Level calls

- get implementation for symbol (name of symbol, line): returns the file
- get documentation for symbol (name of symbol, line): returns the docs
- resolve symbol (name of the symbol, file): will try to resolve the symbol and return the information it has on it
- search docs
- get errors

-> document symbols is always used first to retrieve individual symbols and fine the 
   one with the highest match likelihood
